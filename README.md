# kernelsu_oneplus_7_pro_lineageos_guacamole
A working KernelSU build for the OnePlus 7 Pro (codename Guacamole) on LineageOS.


# WARNING: A data wipe and factory reset are MANDATORY to use this build!

# WARNING: After installation, OTA updates can only be applied using packages signed with Android test keys.

# CAUTION: This build may potentially DAMAGE your device. Proceed at your own risk! Always make a backup before each update!

# Installation
This process is similar to the [official guide](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/guacamole/install/).

Remember to factory reset before and after the installation of [MindTheGapps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps/).

# Notice
1. The build is updated weekly. I will mark the personally tested versions here.
2. This device uses a non-GKI kernel, and KernelSU v0.9.5 is the last supported version for it.
